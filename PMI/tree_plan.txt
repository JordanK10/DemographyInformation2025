# Tree-Structured Visualization for Conditional Mutual Information

## Concept Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a tree-structured visualization for displaying conditional mutual information (CMI) across multiple variables. The visualization resembles a menorah or branching tree, where each branch represents conditioning on specific variable values, and the "leaves" show the mutual information decomposition for the remaining variables.

## Visual Structure

1. **ROOT LEVEL (TRUNK)**
   - Start with a single horizontal row of bars representing the bins of the first conditioning variable
   - Bars are sorted by information content (highest to lowest) or by bin value
   - Each bar width represents proportion of samples in that bin
   - Bar height represents mutual information I(Y;A=a)
   - Clear labels showing the bin value and information quantity

2. **BRANCH LEVEL (LEVEL 2)**
   - From each first-level bar, branch out horizontally to the right
   - Second-level bars represent bins of the second conditioning variable
   - Branches are thinner than the trunk but maintain proportional width based on sample count
   - Heights represent conditional mutual information I(Y;B=b|A=a)
   - Horizontal guide line connects the tops of bars at this level for comparison
   - Branches are spaced with adequate vertical separation

3. **ADDITIONAL BRANCHING (LEVEL 3+)**
   - Continue the pattern for each additional conditioning variable
   - Progressively thinner branches with appropriate spacing
   - Maintain horizontal alignment within each level
   - Clear visual indicators of the path from root to current branch
   - Horizontal guides for comparing information quantities

4. **LEAF LEVEL (TERMINAL NODES)**
   - At each terminal node (after all conditioning variables), display the traditional stacked bar graph
   - Shows mutual information decomposition for remaining variables 
   - Uses the standard I(Y;X₁), I(Y;X₂|X₁), I(Y;X₃|X₁,X₂), etc. pattern
   - Visually distinguish these from the branch structure

## Implementation Components

1. **DATA PROCESSING**
   - Function to create bin combinations across multiple conditioning variables
   - Calculation of mutual information for each bin combination
   - Recursive structure to organize the data in a tree data structure
   - Handling empty or low-sample bins (pruning)

2. **LAYOUT ALGORITHM**
   - Calculate proper vertical and horizontal spacing for all branches
   - Determine branch widths based on sample proportions
   - Implement algorithm to prevent overlap between branches
   - Allocate screen space efficiently

3. **VISUALIZATION RENDERING**
   - Draw bars with appropriate dimensions and styles
   - Connect branches with branches/lines
   - Add horizontal guide lines
   - Implement color scheme (consistent across variables)

4. **LABELING & ANNOTATIONS**
   - Clear labeling for each branch showing the conditioning path
   - Information quantities displayed on or near each bar
   - Legend explaining the visualization structure
   - Optional tooltips for interactive versions

5. **SCALE MANAGEMENT**
   - Handling large trees with many branches
   - Options for pruning insignificant branches
   - Implement collapsible/expandable branches
   - Pagination or scrolling for large visualizations

## Technical Challenges

1. **EXPONENTIAL GROWTH**
   - Number of branches grows exponentially with conditioning variables
   - Implement filtering/thresholding to focus on significant branches
   - Provide options to collapse subtrees

2. **LAYOUT COMPLEXITIES**
   - Avoiding overlaps in complex trees
   - Maintaining readable proportions at deep levels
   - Balancing information density with clarity

3. **INFORMATION DISPLAY**
   - Ensuring information quantities are comparable across branches
   - Handling very small or very large information values
   - Maintaining visual consistency across the tree

4. **PERFORMANCE**
   - Efficient rendering for complex trees
   - Optimizing calculation of mutual information
   - Managing memory usage for large datasets

## Implementation Phases

1. **PROTOTYPE PHASE**
   - Implement for 2 conditioning variables only
   - Simple layout with fixed spacing
   - Basic coloring and labeling
   - Test with small datasets

2. **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION**
   - Support for arbitrary number of conditioning variables
   - Improved layout algorithm
   - Enhanced visual styling
   - Better labeling

3. **ADVANCED FEATURES**
   - Interactive elements (expandable/collapsible)
   - Filtering options
   - Customization of visual elements
   - Export capabilities

4. **OPTIMIZATION**
   - Performance improvements
   - Handle larger datasets
   - Responsive design for different display sizes
   - Documentation and usage examples

## Testing Plan

1. Test with synthetic datasets where information relationships are known
2. Validate with small real-world datasets
3. Stress test with larger datasets and complex variable relationships
4. User testing for readability and interpretability
