# Radial Tree-Structured Visualization for Conditional Mutual Information

## Concept Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a radial tree-structured visualization for displaying conditional mutual information across multiple variables. The visualization uses a circular layout where each level expands outward in rings, representing conditioning on additional variables. The circular design efficiently uses space to handle the exponential growth in combinations.

## Visual Structure

1. **CENTER (ROOT LEVEL)**
   - The visualization begins with the target variable Y at the center
   - The first ring of bars radiates outward from this center point
   - Each bar represents a bin of the first conditioning variable
   - Bar length (radius) represents mutual information I(Y;A=a)
   - Bar width represents proportion of samples in that bin
   - Bars are arranged in a complete circle around the center

2. **MIDDLE RINGS (BRANCH LEVELS)**
   - Each subsequent variable forms a new concentric ring
   - Each bar in the inner ring branches out to multiple bars in the next ring
   - The outer ring bars represent bins of the next conditioning variable
   - Bars are positioned radially, maintaining their angular position from the center
   - Bar length represents conditional mutual information I(Y;B=b|A=a)
   - Circular guide lines connect the tips of bars at each level
   - Color coding distinguishes different variables

3. **OUTER RINGS (DEEPER CONDITIONING)**
   - Additional conditioning variables create new, larger concentric rings
   - The angular width of segments decreases as we move outward to accommodate more combinations
   - Branches maintain their radial alignment
   - Pruning can eliminate branches with low information or sample size 

4. **TERMINAL NODES**
   - At the end of each branch path, small circular plots can display:
     - Distribution of the target variable in this conditional subset
     - Stacked bar representation of remaining variables
     - Numerical values of conditional information

## Implementation Components

1. **DATA PROCESSING**
   - Similar to horizontal layout, but with additional calculations for angular positioning
   - Organization of data in a radial tree structure
   - Calculation of appropriate angular spacing for each branch

2. **RADIAL LAYOUT ALGORITHM**
   - Calculate proper angular width for each branch based on sample proportion
   - Determine radial distance based on information value
   - Implement spacing rules to ensure readability
   - Dynamic pruning threshold based on available space

3. **VISUALIZATION RENDERING**
   - Draw radial bars with curved edges
   - Create concentric circular guidelines
   - Connect branches with curved lines
   - Implement heat-map style color gradients for easy value comparison

4. **LABELING & ANNOTATIONS**
   - Curved text labels following the ring structure
   - Information values displayed at appropriate positions
   - Clear path indicators showing the conditioning chain
   - Legends for variables and color schemes

5. **RING MANAGEMENT**
   - Adjustable ring spacing
   - Option for logarithmic scaling of ring distances
   - Filtering mechanism to show only significant branches

## Advantages of Radial Layout

1. **SPACE EFFICIENCY**
   - Circular design utilizes the entire 2D space rather than just horizontal/vertical dimensions
   - Natural accommodation for exponential growth - outer rings have more circumference
   - More combinations can be displayed in a single figure

2. **INTUITIVE ORGANIZATION**
   - Provides a clear visual hierarchy from center outward
   - Distance from center represents "depth" of conditioning
   - Angular position maintains consistent lineage tracking

3. **COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS**
   - Circular guidelines make it easy to compare information values across branches
   - Shape patterns become recognizable (uniform circles vs. irregular shapes indicate patterns)
   - Global structure is more immediately apparent

4. **SCALABILITY**
   - Can represent more variables before becoming unreadable
   - Better handles the exponential growth of combinations
   - Natural breakpoints for pagination if needed (circular sectors)

## Technical Challenges

1. **ANGULAR RESOLUTION**
   - At deep levels, angular space becomes limited
   - Need to determine minimum readable angular width
   - Implement zoom mechanisms for dense areas

2. **LABELING COMPLEXITY**
   - Curved text is harder to implement and read
   - Space constraints for labels in outer rings
   - Need careful positioning to avoid overlap

3. **RENDERING COMPLEXITY**
   - Curved shapes are more computationally intensive to draw
   - Need for high-resolution rendering
   - More complex coordinate transformations

4. **PERCEPTION CONSIDERATIONS**
   - Ensuring radial distances are perceptually comparable
   - Addressing potential distortion in visual perception of radial vs. linear measures
   - Maintaining readability at all angles
