Data Specifications and Constraints for Mock Data
---------------------------------------------------

1. PersonLopNr:
   - Total data points: 30,000 records.
   - Maximum number of unique individuals: 15,000.
   - Each individual may appear multiple times (over several consecutive years).

2. Income:
   - Income values are capped at 25,000 (currency unspecified).
   - Income is positively correlated with age; later records for an individual should show higher income.
   - Each profession is assigned a unique, non-overlapping income range (no profession’s income range spans the full 0–25,000 domain).
   - Similarly, each university (uni_id) is associated with its own income range—some universities produce wealthier individuals on average, while others yield lower incomes.

3. Profession:
   - Total unique professions: 50.
   - Profession codes must be numeric and vary between 3310 and 3360.
   - Each profession is linked to a specific income range (see Income).

4. Gender:
   - Only two possible values: "m" for male and "f" for female.
   - Gender is randomly assigned for each individual.

5. Education:
   - Education values should be sampled from the set of values present in the original sample file.
   - Only the values that exist in the sample file (e.g., 337, 441, etc.) should be used.

6. City:
   - City names must be selected from the 25 largest cities in Sweden.
   - Only these 25 cities are to be used when assigning city values.

7. Uni_id:
   - Total unique universities: 30.
   - Each uni_id is associated with a unique income range, reflecting differences in wealth outcomes.
   - The income range for each university does not cover the full 0–25,000 spectrum.

8. Ethnicity:
   - Ethnicity is sampled from the existing values in the sample data.
   - An individual’s ethnicity must remain constant across all records.

9. Parental Income:
   - Represented as a percentile (parental_income_percentile7) ranging from 0 to 100.
   - This value is assigned per individual and remains constant over time.

10. Age:
    - The starting age for each individual is uniformly sampled between 20 and 65.
    - For repeated records of the same individual, age increments by 1 for each consecutive record.
    - An individual’s age must always remain within the 20–65 range.

11. Year:
    - Year values range from 1980 to 2025.
    - For consecutive records of the same individual, the year increments by 1 along with the age.
    - The first record for an individual can start at any year between 1980 and 2025, with subsequent records following sequentially.

12. Cohort:
    - Cohort represents the individual’s birth year, calculated as: cohort = year - age.
    - The cohort must remain consistent for each individual across all records.
